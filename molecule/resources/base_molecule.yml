# Provides base configuration for other scenarions
# activates by: molecule -c .../base_molecule.yml
# feature provided are:
#   - collection setup
#   - basic host setup which configures:
#     - virutal-env python for localhost and python3 for ansible nodes
# to override host setting
#   add provisioner configuration to scenario molecule.yml
#   e.g.:
#     provisioner:
#        name: ansible
#        inventory:
#          links:
#            hosts: path to scenarion hosts.yml prefer absolute path ${MOLECULE_SCENARION_DIRECTORY}/hosts.yml
